# Aim:
To simulate and synthesis DECODER2TO4 using Vivado 2023.2.

# Apparatus Required:
Vivado 2023.2.

# Procedure:
1. Open Vivado: Launch Xilinx Vivado software on your computer.

2. Create a New Project: Click on "Create Project" from the welcome page or navigate through "File" > "Project" > "New".

3. Project Settings: Follow the prompts to set up your project. Specify the project name, location, and select RTL project type.

4. Add Design Files: Add your Verilog design files to the project. You can do this by right-clicking on "Design Sources" in the Sources window, then selecting "Add Sources". Choose your Verilog files from the file browser.

5. Specify Simulation Settings: Go to "Simulation" > "Simulation Settings". Choose your simulation language (Verilog in this case) and simulation tool (Vivado Simulator).

6. Run Simulation: Go to "Flow" > "Run Simulation" > "Run Behavioral Simulation". This will launch the Vivado Simulator and compile your design for simulation.

7. Set Simulation Time: In the Vivado Simulator window, set the simulation time if it's not set automatically. This determines how long the simulation will run.

8. Run Simulation: Start the simulation by clicking on the "Run" button in the simulation window.

9. View Results: After the simulation completes, you can view waveforms, debug signals, and analyze the behavior of your design.

# Program:
```
module decoder_8(a,b,c,y);
input a,b,c;
output [7:0]y;
and gl (y[0], (~a), (~b), (~c));
and g2 (y[1], (~a), (~b), (c));
and g3 (y[2], (~a), (b), (~c));
and g4 (y[3], (~a), (b), (c));
and g5(y[4], (a), (~b), (~c));
and g6(y[5], (a), (~b), (c));
and g7(y[6], (a), (b), (~c));
and g8 (y[7], (a), (b), (c));
endmodule
```
# Output:

![decoder](https://github.com/j-gugan/DECODER2TO4/assets/163828735/4d52c131-ef1d-400a-8455-d94411453c25)
# Result
Thus,Decoder2to4 using Vivado 2023.2 simulated and synthesised.
